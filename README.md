## Advancing the Landscape of NL2SQL: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Phi-2 and DeFog Approaches

__Abstract:__

The ongoing evolution of Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) translation presents a critical intersection, accentuating the delicate balance between accuracy and interpretability. This research undertakes a thorough examination of two prominent models, Phi-2 and DeFog, to illuminate the future trajectory of NL2SQL.

While DeFog SQL excels in generating accurate SQL queries, concerns have been raised regarding its internal mechanisms and explainability. In contrast, Phi-2 is a fine-tuned model explicitly designed to prioritize interpretability. This study aims to explore and compare their performance across diverse NL2SQL tasks, introducing a nuanced understanding of their strengths and limitations.

Three pivotal questions guide our investigation:

1. **Accuracy Parity:** Can Phi-2, through fine-tuning, achieve accuracy levels comparable to those of DeFog SQL across a variety of NL2SQL tasks?

2. **Interpretability Enhancement:** Does the fine-tuning of Phi-2 with a SQL dataset result in improved interpretability and explainability of generated queries when compared to DeFog models?

3. **Difficulty Level Dynamics:** How do the performance and interpretability of Phi-2 and DeFog vary across difficulty levels, ranging from Easy to Medium and Hard?

Our comparative analysis aims to bridge the accuracy-interpretability gap inherent in NL2SQL models, shedding light on the unique attributes of both Phi-2 and DeFog approaches. By examining their performance under different difficulty levels, we seek to provide a nuanced understanding of the strengths and weaknesses inherent in each model.

This research not only contributes to the academic discourse surrounding NL2SQL but also holds practical implications for developers and users. The insights gained from this study have the potential to reshape the future of NL2SQL development. By prioritizing explainability alongside accuracy, we aim to pave the way for transparent and trustworthy models. This, in turn, empowers developers and users to confidently interact with and comprehend the logic behind generated SQL queries.

In summary, this dissertation project undertakes a meticulous exploration of Phi-2 and DeFog in the context of NL2SQL, aiming to provide valuable insights that can inform the development and application of these models. Through this comparative analysis, we anticipate contributing to the ongoing dialogue on the intersection of accuracy and interpretability in NL2SQL, with the ultimate goal of advancing the field towards more transparent and user-friendly solutions.
